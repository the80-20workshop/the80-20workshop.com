                    <p>Most hobbies today are designed to make you a <strong>consumer</strong>, not a master. You are told you need the fastest printer, the biggest telescope, the most expensive pedals, and the newest framework just to get started.</p>

                    <p>The 80/20 Workshop is built on a single, unwavering principle:</p>
                    <p class="big-emphasis">20% of the right gear, effort, and technique produces 80% of the results.</p>
