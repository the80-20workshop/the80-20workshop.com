            <h2>The Three Pillars of the 80/20 Lifestyle</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">I arrange my interests into three distinct modes of human engagement. Every project, video, and hack I share falls into one of these buckets.</p>

                    <div class="pillar-goal">The Goal: <strong>Experience</strong></div>
                    <p>Adventure doesn't require a $100,000 rig or a lifetime of savings. It requires the courage to go. By finding the "80/20 sweet spot" in gear—like a $7,000 4WD that performs like a $70,000 one—we unlock the world. Whether it's diving a remote reef or standing under a dark sky, this is about being in the right place at the right time.</p>

                    <p>I believe in mastering the systems behind the objects we love. This is the home of the "Bench Hobbies"—3D printing, model railroading, telescope hacking, and slot cars. Here, we don't buy our way out of problems; we tinker our way into solutions. We focus on the technical 20% that makes our tools—and our hobbies—perform beyond their design.</p>

                    <p>The most powerful tool we own is our mind. We use the 80/20 rule to master skills rapidly—learning the 4 guitar chords that unlock 500 songs or using AI to automate 80% of our programming workload. This is about the systems of life: health, home management, and philosophy. We optimize the human element so we have more time for what truly matters.</p>
